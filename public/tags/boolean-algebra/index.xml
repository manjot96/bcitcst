      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had this course with Carly Orr and honestly, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more simpler. She would go over the same topic at least 2 times a week. She made sure that EVERYONE in the class understood it all. It got pretty boring after a while haha. But hands down she was one of the nicest and easiest teacher in my whole CST career. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone would struggle through this course at all if you have Carly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure she doesn&amp;rsquo;t teach this anymore so my info might be irrelevant&lt;/p&gt;
