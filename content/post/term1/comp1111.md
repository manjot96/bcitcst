This is one of the more laid back and easier courses in first term where you learn about basic "how to use your computer" knowledge and get a little exposure to command line. There is no mid term or final and a majority of the marks (60%) are from the labs which are fairly straight forward and simple to do. Even though it is a simple course it does expose you to some important topic like version control and virtual machines. The rest of the marks are quizzes (20%) and a presentation you give on a topic with a group (20%). Overall a very simple course that shouldn't give you a hard time.
