We had this course with Carly Orr and honestly, it couldn't be more simpler. She would go over the same topic at least 2 times a week. She made sure that EVERYONE in the class understood it all. It got pretty boring after a while haha. But hands down she was one of the nicest and easiest teacher in my whole CST career. I don't think anyone would struggle through this course at all if you have Carly.

I'm pretty sure she doesn't teach this anymore so my info might be irrelevant
