Another super simple course if you have Frank. You learn some useful things too in this, the lectures are pretty dry and you can probably learn everything he teaches in the lectures from the powerpoint slides he provides.

You don't do much in this course, I believe we had a presentation, along with a take home report. That pretty much summed up all the labs for this course. We had a midterm and a final too; he usually tells you the topic the exam will be on prior to it and all you need to do to prepare for it is go through all the examples he's provided. You can get above 80% easily if you just do this. E.g. one of our exam for this course was on writing a complaint letter. Fairly easy if you've gone through the examples.
