COMP 1100 is a pass or fail course, you just need to show up to all the lectures and do the bare minimum on the assignments and quizzes to pass the course. I don't think I've heard of anyone who managed to fail this course.

Usually, the professor brings in some speakers who come and talk about there company. I would suggest paying attention to these types of talks, maybe even write down some notes. When it comes to applying for jobs or internships, you can refer to that talk in your cover letter which will make you seem more appealing to HR.
