Hands down the easiest course of second semester. We only did about 2 main assignments and a single presentation. Besides that there was Resume and a Cover Letter we had to do along with a job interview which was done in a group of 3 with your peers. It seemed like it might be awkward or difficult at first but it ended up being a walk in the park.

There was no midterm, just a final exam. Our final exam did however contain all the things we learned which was writing a proposal and a pitch. Be prepared to go into the final exam and writing a shit load. It's only worth 25% though so if you write down at least something that is somewhat relevant to the topic you're provided than honestly you should be able to get 70+% in the course without even trying.
